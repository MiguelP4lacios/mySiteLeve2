                <h2>Bah√≠a Solano</h2>
                <p>Bah√≠a Solano is a municipality belonging to the department of Choc√≥, located to the northwest of Colombia, on the north coast of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

                <h2>Capurgana</h2>
                <p>Capurgan√° is a remote and vehicle-free village, on the Caribbean coast of Colombia. It can only be accessed by air and sea. It is known for its quiet bays that have dense jungles behind them and have abundant diving sites. Nearby is the beach of El Aguacate, named for its green waters.

                <h2>Quibd√≥</h2>
                <p>Quibd√≥ is a Colombian municipality, capital of the department of Choc√≥ and one of the most important towns in the Colombian Pacific Region.
                <p>The city is located in one of the most biodiverse regions of Colombia, near large ecological reserves such as the Ember√° National Natural Park. It is also one of the regions with the largest number of indigenous reserves.</p>
                <p>Quibd√≥ is located on the right margin of the Atrato River, one of the main tributaries of the country and one of the areas with the highest rainfall in the world. It is located at an altitude of 43 m s. n. m. and has a temperature whose average is 28 ‚ÑÉ. It is 557 kilometers (346 mi) from Bogot√°.</p>
                <p>The city of Quibd√≥ constitutes the only departmental center located between the mountain range and the coast. Due to its characteristics, it is the midpoint of the natural link that exists between the two Colombian coastlines, through the Atrato and San Juan rivers.</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Natural national park Encenada de Utr√≠a</h2>
                <p>The Utria National Natural Park is considered as the only one of its kind because it contains a great variety of ecosystems, ranging from marine to jungle. Framed by the immensity of the Pacific Ocean and the foothills of the Serran√≠a del Baud√≥, it is estimated as one of the most biodiverse national parks not only within Colombia but in the world.</p>
                <p>It is currently in great danger, because among the proposals of the National Development Plan, a proposal that aims to build the largest port in Colombia, with the capacity to receive ships of up to 200,000 tons, takes force. The impacts that this big build would generate on the environment would be disastrous and irreversible.</p>
